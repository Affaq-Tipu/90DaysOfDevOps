**Task**

**Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud**
**What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?**

DevOps is a culture + practices + tools that bring developers (Dev) and operations (Ops) together.
Core idea:
You build it, you run it — together.
What DevOps focuses on:
Automation → CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
Faster releases → multiple deploys per day instead of once a month
Reliability → monitoring, logging, alerts
Collaboration → less “blame game”, more shared responsibility

**Cloud Engineering:**
       Cloud Engineering is about designing, building, and managing infrastructure on the cloud.

What Cloud Engineers focus on:

Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
Scalability (handle 10 users → 10 million users)
Availability & security
Cost optimization (FinOps comes here)

**Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?**
I started learning devops because 
High industry demand and long-term career growth
The opportunity to work on real-world production systems
Continuous learning in tools like Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
Strong relevance in remote and global job markets

**Where do you want to reach?**

I want to grow into a senior DevOps/Cloud Engineer who owns infrastructure, drives automation, and ensures reliable, scalable systems

**How you will stay consistent every single day?**

I stay consistent by building daily habits, setting small goals, and focusing on progress—not motivation.
Consistency for me is about showing up daily even if the progress is small—because small steps compound over time.
